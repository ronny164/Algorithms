# Princeton - Algorithms course

Programming exercise from the course in Coursera. Implemented all of them on my own by watching lecture and reading their book.

Covers:
* Disjoint-sets (UnionFind)
* LinkedList, ArrayList, Stacks, Queues, Deque
* RandomizedQueue, RandomizedSet.
* Heap (Priority Queue)
* Red-black BST
* Hashtables, Multi-value map, bidirectional map.
* Sorting (selection, insertion, merge, quick, heap, counting, radix, bucket)
* Kd-Tree (2d Nearest neighbor search & range search)
* Graphs (undirected, directed, weighted, etc)
* BFS (breadth first search), DFS (depth first search)
* A* algorithm (best first search), game tree
* Shortest anscestral path
* Weighted shortest path
* Max-flow/min-cut
* Trie (Radix Tree)
